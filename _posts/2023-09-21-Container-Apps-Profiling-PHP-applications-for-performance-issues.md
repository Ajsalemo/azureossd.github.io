This post will cover using troubleshooting tools to help profile performance issues on Container Apps with PHP applications.

# Overview
Sometimes, applications may encounter issues due to poor performance - either high CPU usage, high memory (or out of memory), generally slow performance due to code execution logic, or others.

In these scenarios, if it's been determined this _is_ likely an application problem, you can use troubleshooting tooling to profile or take dumps of the application.

# Important Prerequisites
Some **important** prerequisites is to be able to:
- Being able to connect to the container through the **Console** blade or use the [`az containerapp exec`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/containerapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-containerapp-exec) command. See console documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/container-console?tabs=bash)
- Able to download files from the container

## Console access
You can use either the Azure CLI or the portal for console access. Below is what portal access would look like:

![Console access from portal](/media/2023/08/aca-java-ts-1.png)

These commands for capturing profiles and dumps require access to a terminal - so console access is required.

## Download files from the container
You'll need a way to download files from the container. By default, there is no way to get files generated at runtime by a container in Container Apps without some additional configuration.

The most simplistic way is to mount a volume from an Azure File Share with an Azure Storage Account.

For a quickstart on how to add a volume, follow [Use storage mounts in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/storage-mounts?pivots=azure-portal)

**NOTE**: It is advised to add this mount _before_ testing or generating files. If you do this _after_ testing (and in single revision mode, for instance) then a new pod will be created and previous files would be lost.

You can validate that the volume is mounted with the `df -h` command:

![Storage volume check](/media/2023/08/aca-java-ts-2.png)

# Determining high CPU or memory
## Diagnose and Solve problems
You can use the following detectors in the **Diagnose and Solve Problems** blade to diagnose these issues:
- **Container App Memory Usage**
- **Container App CPU usage**

## Metrics blade
You can use the following metric breakdowns in the **Metrics** blade to diagnose these issues:
- **CPU usage**
- **Memory Working Set Bytes**
- **Reserved Cores**
- **Total Reserved Cores**

## cgroupv2 change
See this GitHub issue - [Mitigate Potential Memory Pressure Effects With cgroup v2](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-container-apps/issues/724) - With the change for cgroupv2 from cgroupv1 can introduce unexpected memory management issues for applications. 

# Generating dumps or profiling
## Best practices
When taking a heap dump, thread dump, or profiling - it is recommended to take a few of these while reproducing the issue for consistent data.

Taking only (1) may show data that is ultimately not relevant - taking multiple of these will show a more consistent theme in terms of what the problem may be - and would be easier to troubleshoot.

There are times when taking multiple dumps/profiles, you may notice one has a variation of data - if this happened to be the one dump/profile you took (if only taking one total), this can cause the investigation to go down the wrong path.

> **NOTE**: When profiling an application, there is the chance this creates further negative performance impact (while profiling is occurring). This should be noted, especially for production environments. 

# Profilers
## Xdebug 
[XDebug](https://xdebug.org/) is a PHP profiler and debugger. XDebug outputs these profiles as `cachegrind` files, which can be read by various programs - including GUI-based programs.

Enabling this will vary depending on the `Dockerfile` and base image type (eg., Alpine, Debian, etc).

You can enable Xdebug by adding a few lines to your `Dockerfile`.

```Dockerfile
RUN pecl install xdebug && \
    docker-php-ext-enable xdebug && \
    echo "xdebug.remote_autostart=off" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini &&  \
    echo "xdebug.output_dir=/path/to/volume/mount" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini && \
    echo "xdebug.mode=profile" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini && \
    echo "xdebug.start_with_request=trigger" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini && \
```

> This installation was tested on a Debian-based image, other distro installations may vary

In the above lines, we are:
- Using `pecl` to install `xdebug` and enabling the extension with `docker-phpext-enable`
- Configuring Xdebug by writing into its `.ini`, such as specifying the directory to save `cachegrind` (profile) files, setting the mode, and for it to only profile when we trigger it 

### Troubleshooting
**Issue**:

`Xdebug: [Profiler] File '/path/to/cachegrind.out.xx' could not be opened`

- **Cause**:

  - Xdebug likely does not have proper permissions to create the `cachegrind` file under the specified directory

- **Resolution**:
  - Ensure the directory configured for saved files gives the container user appropriate permissions to write to the specified location

### Downloading saved files
With the storage volume configured - you can download these files from your Azure File share

### Generating a cachegrind file from XDebug
After enabling XDebug with any of the above methods, to generate the cachegrind file, go to your site and add `?XDEBUG_PROFILE=1` to the end of the URL. Example:

```
 https://yoursite.funnyname-1234b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io?XDEBUG_PROFILE=1
```

### Reviewing XDebug profiles
#### WinCacheGrind (Deprecated)
As per [http://ceefour.github.io/wincachegrind/](http://ceefour.github.io/wincachegrind/), WinCacheGrind is no longer maintained.

If you want a quick guide on how to walk through opening and reviewing `cachegrind` files with WinCacheGrind, review the [Debugging PHP Applications on Azure App Services Linux/Containers using XDEBUG - Analyzing the XDEBUG profile](https://azureossd.github.io/2020/05/05/debugging-php-application-on-azure-app-service-linux/index.html#analyzing-the-xdebug-profile) section which covers this.

#### QcacheGrind
QCacheGrind is now the recommended method of reviewing `cachegrind` output per the [WinCacheGrind](https://ceefour.github.io/wincachegrind/) page. 

If the SourceForge build has issues opening due to a missing DLL, you can try newer builds in the community, such as [here](https://www.seidengroup.com/profiling-tools-for-php-qcachegrind-download/).

The approach to reviewing a profile is very similar to that of WinCacheGrind. Below are some important columns to note while reviewing:

- **Inclusive:** The time spent in the function and any functions called
- **Self:** The time spent in the function and not any functions called
- **Called:** How many times the function was called
- **Function:** The function that was called
- **Location:** The file (or if it is internal to PHP) the function was in

The default view will look as the below, organized by the function spending most Inclusive time from the top-down:

![QCacheGrind - UI](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-1.png)

We can sort by **self** for functions who may have spent the most time on itself. Click the column name to sort by this. A feature of QCacheGrind is that it comes with a **Call Graph** for visualized call output. Take the below `sleep()` call that was in a controller named `SleepController`:

![QCacheGrind - Call Map](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-2.png)

You can further review the caller of this function well as all callers that were apart of the chain of functions leading to this call through the **All Callers** tab:

These tabs can be explained more by the following:

**The top part of the right pane contains different tabs:**
- **Types:** Shows each measured component of the function.
- **Callers:** Shows direct callers of the function.
- **All Callers:** Shows indirect callers of the function.
- **Callee Map:** Shows a heatmap representation of the callee view.
- **Source Code:** Shows the lines of source in the file the function has.

**The bottom part of the right pane contains different tabs:**
- **Callees:** Shows the direct functions called by the function.
- **Call Graph:** Shows a visualization of call flow.
- **All Callers:** Shows all functions that get called by the function
- **Caller Map:** Shows a heatmap representation of the caller view.
- **Machine Code:** Shows a low level disassembly. Not relevant to PHP, but used if youâ€™re looking at C/C++ programs with Valgrind.

**The toolbars and menu bar contain more options:**
- **Detect Cycles:** Try to handle recursion more optimally.
- **Event Type:** Visualize by time spent or memory.
- **Show Percentage Relative to Parent**
- **Show Relative Costs:** Shows relative percentage instead of exact cost.

#### VSCode
You can easily look through `cachegrind` files generated by Xdebug with Visual Studio Code. To do this, you'll need the [PHP Profiler Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.profiler-php-vscode#:~:text=Alternatively%2C%20if%20your%20profile%20file%20name%20is%20in,editor%20-%20using%20File%20%2F%20Open%20File%20menu.) - however, having the full [PHP Tools for Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode) is recommended.

You can also drag-and-drop the generated `cachegrind` files without the need to extract these. If these are generated in a `.gz` format, you can drag-and-drop these directly into a VSCode window - as well as loading already extracted `cachegrind` files.

This will load in a hierarchy view as below:

![VSCode - Call Map](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-4.png)

This will show the:
- **Function Name**: The invoked function
- **Calls**: How many times it was called
- **Self Time (milliseconds)**: Time spent on itself
- **Time (milliseconds)**: Time spent on the function plus other functions invoked from it
- **Path**: The code path where this was executed

If you switch to the **Function Details** view, this turns into a horizontal drill-down flow:

![VSCode - Call Map](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-5.png)

In this view, you can click on each function, which will step through the series of function invocations (if any). If a function invoked another function, and so on, you can walk through this flow - to see where total time was spent.

This is shown in the above and below screenshots with the **Calling function**, **Current function** (currently selected function), and **Called functions** (functions called by the current function):

![VSCode - Call Map](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-6.png)

Drilling down can help determine where in code time was spent, as seen below:

![VSCode - Call Map](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-7.png)

Ultimately, this is an incredibly simple way to review a profile during performance issues.

Additionally, if you run this alongside the appropriate source code - there is the option for **code highlighting** on the affected path. More information can be found in the [PHP Profiler Extension documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.profiler-php-vscode#:~:text=Alternatively%2C%20if%20your%20profile%20file%20name%20is%20in,editor%20-%20using%20File%20%2F%20Open%20File%20menu.).

# Debuggers
Debuggers may not capture the same information of an application in the same way typical profilers would, but it can still show useful information for less intensive troubleshooting of performance. 

## PHP Debug Bar
PHP Debug bar is a debug and profiling tool that can help catch slow performance and/or general errors and exceptions. When enabled, this shows up at the bottom of the browser page and as expandable bar.

![PHP Debug Bar UI](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-8.png)

By default, this comes pre-configured with the **Messages**, **Request**, **Timeline** and **Exception** tab. As well as showing additional information such as memory usage for the page being hit, request duration and PHP version.

- **Messages**: Any messages (like console messages) written while invoking the route.
- **Request**: Shows various information on the request, as well as information on these PHP variables - `$_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_SERVER`. For instance, `$_SERVER` will show various server side environment variables in an array.
- **Timeline**: This will show the time taken between two points of interest within the codebase. This will can be set by start or stop functions.
- **Exceptions**: This will display any exceptions or errors for the page/route invoked.

Documentation for PHP Debug Bar can be found [here](http://phpdebugbar.com/docs/readme.html#installation).

### Installation
PHP Debug bar depends on composer to be used to install the package.

Create a `composer.json` file in the root of your project folder with the following:

```json
{
    "require": {
      "maximebf/debugbar": "1.*"
    }
}
```

Add the following lines to your PHP file in question:

(example index.php)
```php
<?php
use DebugBar\StandardDebugBar;

$debugbar = new StandardDebugBar();
$debugbarRenderer = $debugbar->getJavascriptRenderer();

$debugbar["messages"]->addMessage("hello world!");
?>
<html>
  <head>
      <?php echo $debugbarRenderer->renderHead() ?>
  </head>
  <body>
      echo "Hello, from PHP Debug Bar";
      <?php echo $debugbarRenderer->render() ?>
   </body>
</html>
```

### Adding non-default collectors
Review the documentation [here](http://phpdebugbar.com/docs/data-collectors.html#using-collectors) for adding performance collectors that are not set by default.

> **NOTE**: If you try to add a collector through PHP that already exists, you'll see this: `PHP message: PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught DebugBar\DebugBarException: 'time' is already a registered collector in /home/site/wwwroot/vendor/maximebf/debugbar/src/DebugBar/DebugBar.php`

### Timing long running operations
Since a majority of PHP applications are stateful (usually calling towards a database, other external storage dependency, or API) - this can have performance implications in certain scenarios.

If a piece of code or operation is suspected to be an issue, we can chart this operation to see the time taken between two points. Consider the following test:

```php
// This mimics a long running operation
$debugbar['time']->startMeasure('longop', 'My long operation');
sleep(5);

$debugbar['time']->stopMeasure('longop');
// This mimics a long running operation
$debugbar['time']->measure('My long operation', function() {
    sleep(2);
});
```

This measures two points and then measures the operation by name ('My long operation'). The output would be seen in the **Timeline** tab of the bar. This includes time spent for both operations, as well as total time.

## Laravel Debug Bar
This is a package specific to Laravel - based off of PHP Debug Bar - it is a profiler and general debug tool designed to help catch slow performance and/or general errors and exceptions

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)

### How to enable
- Install the package via composer with `composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev`
- Set the environment variable `APP_DEBUG` to `true`

> **NOTE**: If `APP_DEBUG` is false, the bar will not show, by design.

When enabled, the bar will show at the bottom of the page and look like the following:

![Laravel Debug Bar UI](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-10.png)

- **Timeline**: The request duration and breakdown. With a breakdown on how much of this was application time:

![Laravel Debug Bar UI](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-11.png)

- **Messages**: Any messages (like console messages) written while invoking the route.
- **Exceptions**: Any exceptions thrown during the handling of the request
- **Views**: Views rendered for the route accessed, as well as view information - such as view path in Laravel.
- **Route**: Various route information, such as the controller and method in the controller invoking the request, namespace, prefixes (if applicable), route 'name' (if applicable) and file the Controller lives in.
- **Queries**: If any queries were executed on the route
- **Models**: Models used on the route
- **Session**: Information on active sessions
- **Request**: Various request information - such as status code, status text, format, content type, request headers and server environment variables, request cookies, etc.

Current route, memory usage, request duration and PHP version are also some of the options shown.

## Kint
Kint is a debugger that has a UI in the same form of what Laravel Debug Bar and PHP Debug Bar has.

Documentation for Kint can be found [here](https://kint-php.github.io/kint/).

### Installation
With `composer` on your local environment, run the following:

```
composer require kint-php/kint
```
> **NOTE**: If a `composer.json` file doesn't exist yet, create one first and add an empty object into the file - ex. `{}`

This will create a `vendor` folder. Depending on your project, you need to do one of the following:
- If using plain PHP, require the `vendor` folder with `autoload` - `include 'vendor/autoload.php';`
- If using a framework, it most likely is already including the `vendor` folder into the project.

Next, use the following, either at an application entry point of a point of possible slowness:

```php
d($response);
```

In this case, this was used in Laravel's `public/index.php` file - since this is where responses are sent from. The syntax and usage for Kint is simple enough that all it requires is the `d()` function, which is a shorthand for Kint usage. `d()` requires one (1) argument, which is what is being dumped.

`d()` will automatically be in scope and available if imported/installed.

The following UI will be shown if succesful:

![Laravel Debug Bar UI](/media/2023/07/azure-oss-blog-php-perf-12.png)

This includes the entirety of the response and more, from a deeper application standpoint - showing all functions that may have been invoked or used. Each property and available methods can be looked into. This also shows the location of where `d()` was invoked from.

### Troubleshooting
If no UI is appearing, move the `d()` function to a more appropriate place in the application that can return a response. You may also need to validate what kind of argument is being passed into `d()`.
