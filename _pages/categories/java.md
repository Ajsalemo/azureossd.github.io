App Service on Linux supports `Java` as a runtime stack built-in image, and `Java SE`  or `Apache Tomcat` as Java Web Server stack.

>**Java Runtime Support** - Microsoft and Adoptium builds of OpenJDK are provided and supported on App Service for Java 8, 11, and 17. You can check the JDK versions and Security updates in [Java runtime statement of support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-language-java?pivots=platform-linux#java-runtime-statement-of-support).
