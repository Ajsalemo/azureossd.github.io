App Service on Linux supports `Python` as a runtime stack built-in image.

>**Python Update Policy** - App Service upgrades the underlying Python runtime of your application as part of the regular platform updates. As a result of this regular update process, your application will be automatically updated to the latest patch version of Python available for that platform. For more information about current supported Python versions check [Support Timeline](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/Runtime_Support/python_support.md#support-timeline).
